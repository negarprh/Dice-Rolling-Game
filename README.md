# Dice Rolling Game ðŸŽ²

This is a simple Python-based dice rolling game where players roll a die, and the outcome is displayed on the terminal. It includes two main files:

1. `dice_rolling_game.py`: The core game logic for rolling the dice and displaying the result.
2. `map_of_game.py`: A guideline (map) explaining what to write in each line of the game code, with comments to make it easier to follow.

## Features
- Roll a 6-sided die with a random outcome.
- Simple and easy-to-understand Python code.
- Step-by-step explanation of the code in the `map_of_game.py` file.
  
## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Dice-Rolling-Game.git
   cd Dice-Rolling-Game
   ```

2. Run the game in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python dice_rolling_game.py
   ```

3. The game will roll a die and display the result in the terminal.

## Example

Below is an example of what you'll see in the terminal after running the game:

## Code Explanation

The game is structured as follows:

- **dice_rolling_game.py**: Contains the logic to simulate a die roll using Python's built-in `random` module. The result is displayed to the user in the terminal.
- **map_of_game.py**: Step-by-step breakdown of the game code with comments on what each section does.

## Future Improvements
- Add a multi-player feature to keep track of scores.
- Allow the user to choose the number of sides on the die.
